6. Select the correct order of how does a servlet obtains information (context and configuration information) from the deployment descriptor?



1)     The container passes the ServletConfig object to the init() method of the servlet to initialize it.

2)     When a Web application is deployed, the Web container obtains the information from the deployment descriptor and initializes a ServletConfig object and a ServletContext object with it.

3)     The servlet can then obtain information, such as its initialization parameter using the ServletConfig object.

4)     The servlet can then call methods of the ServletContext object to obtain information, such as the context initialization parameters that was specified in the deployment descriptor.

12. Identify the correct sequence in which the Web container calls the life cycle methods of a servlet:



1)     On the arrival of first HTTP request, the Web container loads the servlet class and creates one or more instances of the servlet class.

2)     The Web container invokes the init() method of the servlet instance during initialization of the servlet. The init() method is invoked only once in the servlet life cycle.

3)     The Web container calls the destroy() method before removing the servlet instance from the service. The destroy() method is also invoked only once in a servlet life cycle.

4)     The Web container invokes the service() method to allow a servlet to process a client request.

5)     The servlet then
 waits to receive and process subsequent client requests. 
6)     The service() method processes the request and returns the response back to the Web container, by calling certain doXxx() method.
